Mask Detector with Jetson Nano
In this project, we will be using the Jetson Nano and a USB camera to create a mask detector that detects humans with or without masks.
As Omicron and other variants surge in various parts of the world, it is important to keep our masks on.  This project just shows one way artificial intelligence can be used to create real-world impact.  In restaurants or closed-off areas, this mask detector can be used to detect many human beings at once to recognize if they are wearing their masks.
